Solution approarch :
There are 3 elements in this game 1. Robot 2. Table 3. Rules of the game
1. Main class to run and process CLI input
2. ToyRobot only understands the moves(it doesnt know about the validity of the move)
3. GridTable can give us information about whether a point is a valid position in the table.
4. Game implementation(ToyRobotGame) handles the abstration of Robot, Table and applyes the rules of the game
